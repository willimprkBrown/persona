            <h1>Persona Project</h1>

            <p>This project will look at the experiences of users with the Ten One Tea House ordering kiosk. User intereactions
            with the kiosk will be observed and users will be interviewed on their experiences with the interface. From these
            observations and interviews, personas will be created to represent the different types of users that interact with
            the kiosk. These personas will be used to create a storyboard that will show how certain users are expected to interact with
            the kiosk.</p>

            <h1>Interface</h1>
            <p>The interface I choose to base my project on is the Ten One Tea House ordering kiosk. Below is a simplified diagram with the key compoenents of the interface:</p>
            <img src={interfaceImage} alt="Kiosk Interface" className="kiosk-image" />
            <p className='center'>The kiosk is trying to reduce the workload of drink orders on workers and streamline the ordering process for users. The interface is a physical kiosk that is attached to the kisok stand
            The kiosk interface is a touch screen that allows users to select and order drinks from the Ten One Tea House menu. The interface has several digital components (ex. buttons) that allow users to navigate through the menu, 
            select and customize drinks, and prompt the user to make a payment. There is then a card swiper/scanner to allow users to make payment transactions.</p>
            <h1>User Responses</h1>
            <p>3 users were interviewed and asked the following questions:</p>

                the personas's thoughts, feelings, and actions when interacting with the kiosk. The two personas are Vivienne and Tom.
            </p>
            <h2>Vivienne</h2>
            <img src={viviennePicture} alt="Vivienne" className="profile-image" />

            <ul className='ul-desc'>
                <li className='li-desc'><strong>Description:</strong> A college student who likes getting boba often. An ambitious and diligent person who enjoys taking breaks, especially for boba.</li>
                <li className='li-desc'><strong>Problems Vivienne faces:</strong> A problem Vivienne faces is that she has to go through the entire process over and over again when ordering a drink. She has to remake her favorite order and decline paper cups every time she visits.</li>
                <li className='li-desc'><strong>Why Vivienne?</strong> The majority of people who drink boba at Ten One Tea House are college students. A large number of people who go to Ten One Tea House have previously been there and are familiar with the ordering kiosk. Vivienneâ€™s experience and problems with the interface are shared by many, making her persona one that encompasses a large population of users.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src={vivienneMap} alt="Vivienne Empathy Map" className="map-image" />

            <h2>Tom</h2>
            <img src={tomPicture} alt="Tom" className="profile-image" />

            <ul className='ul-desc'>
                <li className='li-desc'><strong>Description:</strong> A millennial consultant who is in the workforce. Lives a simple and frugal life but wants to keep up with the younger generation.</li>
                <li className='li-desc'><strong>Problems Tom faces:</strong> Tom struggles with selecting a drink he wants and has to constantly scroll through all of the options. He is also confused about what comes with his drink.</li>
                <li className='li-desc'><strong>Why Tom?</strong> People who have not had boba or do not know what it is may struggle with choosing a drink. People ordering boba for the first time will learn and interact with the kiosk the most to learn more about their drink options and what/how to order. Tomâ€™s experience encompasses the problems of someone having boba or interacting with this interface for the first time, which has been everyone at least once.</li>
            </ul>
